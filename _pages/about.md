I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at [School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://saids.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC). My research interests include intelligent education, computerized adaptive testing, and large language model evaluation, with a focus on advancing assessment methodologies and AI-driven educational technologies.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qi Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/) of [State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Intelligence](https://cogskl.iflytek.com/)
